# PLANTATION EVENTS
tea_build_plantation_1_start;Your time with the Tea Enthusiasts has been inspirational, and over the last few weeks, you've been mulling the idea of growing a tea-leaf garden of your own. Others have done it, so why not you? Mind abuzz with thoughts of hosting tea parties with homegrown blends, you start considering the cost of such an endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_1;Gardening books! New tools! Fertilisers! Every coin is worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_2;I can get started on a modest budget.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_3;How hard can it be to buy some seeds and water some plants?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_fail;Unfortunately, the tea bushes you planted did not take. Perhaps gardening is not your strong suite.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_fail_option;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_finish;It may have started slow, but your tea garden is finally bearing fruit -- or rather, leaves. In celebration, you decide to christen your harvest by inviting over your friends for tea, in what will surely be the first of many such parties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_finish_option;Drink up, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start;You've spent quite a lot of time enjoying the tea-leaf garden you inherited, both in harvesting leaves, and handing out packets of seeds to friends who adore your tea. Lately, though, you can't help but feel the garden is a bit... small. Your ancestor was a master caretaker, and the bushes they planted are well bred... but everything is so confined! Surely, by spreading such strong seeds to nearby land, your estate will flourish with tea bushes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_gold;I'll hire some gardeners to make sure the new bushes are tended.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_self;Time to get my hands dirty!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_spirits;Perhaps I should add some sacred soil from the forest?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_free;Let me just throw around some seeds, and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_bail;On second thought, the garden is a fine size.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_fail;After several years of waiting, the tea bushes you cast seeds for never took root. Perhaps your ancestor knew better, and that's why they stuck with such a small garden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_fail_option;At least I still have the garden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish;Several years ago, you planted tea seeds around your land, hoping to expand a single garden to a near-jungle of tea leaves. Peaking out your window, you now overlook a resplendent grove, bustling with bushes, dotted with all sorts of hybrids growing among them. Truly, there is nowhere on your estate you can go where a tea bush isn't within reach.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_self;I think I'm getting the hang of this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_spirits;What strange leaves! I wonder what the tea will taste like?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1;Some time ago, your family planted a tea-leaf garden on the estate, and after allowing those bushes to expand into the surrounding nature, ended up with a vibrant grove entangled everything nearby. Of course, this gift was part of your inheritance -- after so many generations of caretakers, the responsibility finally falls on you to maintain it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1_option;Perhaps there is more I can do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_2;Surveying the untamed wilds of leaves and vines, you begin to think of how else you might manage such a grove. Why stop at just tending and pruning? With a little organisation, this grove could be developed into a real farm, with a set harvest, and a knowledgeable staff overseeing it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_1;Find me the best farmers in the land, and I will pay handsomely!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_self;I will plead my case to the townsfolk to help!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_spirits;I will seek guidance from the Spirits, to form a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_2;I can pay some farmers modestly to handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_bail;This will be too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish;You wipe the sweat from your brow as you head in, satisfied after a hard day's work in the field. What was once untamed and erratic is now a meticulously organised farm, with rows of bushes, and even set ground for crossbreeding new tea leaves. It wasn't easy, but because of your efforts, you were able to reign in the grove you were handed-down, and make the harvest even more bountiful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_self;Just an honest day's work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_spirits;Thank the Spirits for blessing my estate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_fail;Once again looking out upon your estate, you see your efforts to tame the wilds have been largely frivolous. You tried your best, but perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_fail_option;Oh well, I can still enjoy the grove.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1;Your family's tea farm has become quite famous, boasting not only generations of caretakers, but generations of patrons. However, that popularity ends at your borders -- truthfully, as well tended as the farms are, their tea production simply isn't high enough to meet the demand outside your own lands. Puzzling over this problem, you lock yourself in your study.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1_option;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_2;Labouring into the night, you draw up plans for a grand plantation -- not just one, but tens or perhaps even hundreds of well-tended farms. You will drive production so high that every tea shop across the Four Nations will stock your familial blends. Such an endeavour will be massive, and thus your plan will have to be meticulous.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_1;No cost is too great.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_self;This will be our glory! This will be the plantation of the people!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_spirits;I have sought the Spirits before, I shall do so again!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_2;If I'm careful, I can do this on a budget.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_bail;I need more time to gather resources.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_finish;After almost a decade of labour, your grand vision has been realised: from a humble garden, to a blossoming grove, to a well-kept farm, and now finally to this, a colossal plantation, the absolute apex of a generational love of tea and the desire to spread that passion. Perusing the newly-leafed fields, you think back to all the work your forefathers put in before you, and how all of this must have started with a single inspirational thought after a warm cup of tea. You also think forward, to your children, and their children, and all your descendants, who will always have this plantation as part of their lives, and will feel you and your ancestors love through it. What you've built here isn't just a handful of farms, it's a monument to your whole family, past and future, and by the Spirits, it is glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_finish_option;It is magnificent!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_fail;It would seem that starting a tea plantation is much more difficult then it seems. Although there's no recouping the money you've sunk into this, you feel like any more investments would just be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_fail_option;The farm is enough, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;x
