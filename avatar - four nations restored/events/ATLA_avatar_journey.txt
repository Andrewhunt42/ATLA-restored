# overhaul of borked avatar events from "ATLA_avatar.txt" file

# instead of simple master-based wait-and-win old events,
# the new ones will focus on the journey
# instead of random-based progress, 
# the new ones will consider lifestyle, vice and virtue traits

# Reserved event ids:
# 1-99 - common avatar events (disasters & flavours)
# 100-199 - waterbending journey
# 200-299 - earthbending journey
# 300-399 - firebending journey
# 400-499 - airbending journey

# Travel to Air Nomads
# On the path of the Avatar, 
# the journey to one of the Four Air Temples was always one of the most difficult challenges.
# The Air Nomads live in isolation, their major centers located on four edges of the world: 
# In the mountains, high above the sky, and under the cliffs, where they cannot be seen from the ground.
# Sometimes they can be seen in the foothill towns or on islands like Kyoshi,
# where they ask for alms, or trade, buy food, and fly away. 
# They would welcome a fellow traveler, 
# It would not be out of place to say that once Avatar is nominated, they are among the first to send ambassadors, 
# they treat teaching Avatar as one of their main goals in life.
# "By ship or by foot, always move against the Wind, to the places where it is born." - was the last thing I was told.

# Arrival on Whaletail
# After months of sailing, the ship entered the foggy waters of Whaletail Island.
# The island was always surrounded by fogs, the air here was cold from the fast sea currents of the South Sea,
# and only high towers of temples on the hills saved ships from eternal wandering in frosty oblivion to the inevitable crash on the reefs.
# It was rumored that the fogs were created here by waterbenders to prevent ships of other nations from fishing here.
# Others considered this a manifestation of ancient spirits, like the Spirit of Mist, as ancient as the Spirits of the Moon and the Ocean
# Although the air nomads do not like to settle on the coast, the fogs protected them as well as mountains and cliffs.
# The island has a tradition of fasting, 
# and every summer hundreds and thousands of air nomads go on pilgrimage to this island, to the place where Monk Tang Xu fasted for 98 days.
# Here, I think I'll find fellow travelers to the Southern Air Temple.
