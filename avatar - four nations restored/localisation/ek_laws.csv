succ_earth_king;Earth Kingdom Elective;;;;;;;;;;;;;
succ_earth_king_desc;Earth Kingdom Elective is the unique succession law used to determine the next monarch to grace the Badgermole Throne. In the current lord's court, each ruler, councilor, consort, relative, commander and powerful vassal is considered eligible to vote. Their influence is broken down by their status -- vassal rulers have 10 votes, councilors have 8, powerful vassals and commanders have 6, and relatives have 4. Only former ruling dynasty members, current ruling dynasty members, claimants, and those related by the ancient bloodline of the Earth Kingdom  are considered valid candidates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
