# PLANTATION EVENTS

tea_build_plantation_1_start;Your time with the Tea Enthusiasts has been inspirational, and over the last few weeks, you've been mulling the idea of growing a tea-leaf garden of your own. Others have done it, so why not you? Mind abuzz with thoughts of hosting tea parties with homegrown blends, you start considering the cost of such an endeavor.;
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_1;Gardening books! New tools! Fertilizers! Every coin is worth it!;
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_2;I can get started on a modest budget.;
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_3;How hard can it be to buy some seeds and water some plants?;

tea_build_plantation_1_fail;Unfortunately, the tea bushes you planted did not take. Perhaps gardening is not your strong suite.;
tea_build_plantation_1_fail_option;Unfortunate.;

tea_build_plantation_1_finish;It may have started slow, but your tea garden is finally bearing fruit -- or rather, leaves. In celebration, you decide to christen your harvest by inviting over your friends for tea, in what will surely be the first of many such parties.;
tea_build_plantation_1_finish_option;Drink up, everyone!;

tea_build_plantation_2_start;You've spent quite a lot of time enjoying the tea-leaf garden you inherited, both in harvesting leaves, and handing out packets of seeds to friends who adore your tea. Lately, though, you can't help but feel the garden is a bit... small. Your ancestor was a master caretaker, and the bushes they planted are well bred... but everything is so confined! Surely, by spreading such strong seeds to nearby land, your estate will flourish with tea bushes.;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_gold;I'll hire some gardeners to make sure the new bushes are tended.;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_self;Time to get my hands dirty!;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_spirits;Perhaps I should add some sacred soil from the forest?;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_free;Let me just throw around some seeds, and see what happens.;
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_bail;On second thought, the garden is a fine size.;

tea_build_plantation_2_fail;After several years of waiting, the tea bushes you cast seeds for never took root. Perhaps your ancestor knew better, and that's why they stuck with such a small garden.;
tea_build_plantation_2_fail_option;At least I still have the garden.;

tea_build_plantation_2_finish;Several years ago, you planted tea seeds around your land, hoping to expand a single garden to a near-jungle of tea leaves. Peaking out your window, you now overlook a resplendent grove, bustling with bushes, dotted with all sorts of hybrids growing among them. Truly, there is nowhere on your estate you can go where a tea bush isn't within reach.;
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_self;I think I'm getting the hang of this!;
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_spirits;What strange leaves! I wonder what the tea will taste like?;

tea_build_plantation_3_start_1;Some time ago, your family planted a tea-leaf garden on the estate, and after allowing those bushes to expand into the surrounding nature, ended up with a vibrant grove entangled everything nearby. Of course, this gift was part of your inheritance -- after so many generations of caretakers, the responsibility finally falls on you to maintain it.;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1_option;Perhaps there is more I can do?;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_2;Surveying the untamed wilds of leaves and vines, you begin to think of how else you might manage such a grove. Why stop at just tending and pruning? With a little organization, this grove could be developed into a real farm, with a set harvest, and a knowledgeable staff overseeing it.;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_1;Find me the best farmers in the land, and I will pay handsomely!;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_self;I will plead my case to the townsfolk to help!;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_spirits;I will seek guidance from the Spirits, to form a plan!;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_2;I can pay some farmers modestly to handle this.;
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_bail;This will be too expensive.;
tea_build_plantation_3_finish;You wipe the sweat from your brow as you head in, satisfied after a hard day's work in the field. What was once untamed and erratic is now a meticulously organized farm, with rows of bushes, and even set ground for crossbreeding new tea leaves. It wasn't easy, but because of your efforts, you were able to reign in the grove you were handed-down, and make the harvest even more bountiful.;
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_self;Just an honest day's work.;
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_spirits;Thank the Spirits for blessing my estate.;
tea_build_plantation_3_fail;Once again looking out upon your estate, you see your efforts to tame the wilds have been largely frivolous. You tried your best, but perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.;
tea_build_plantation_3_fail_option;Oh well, I can still enjoy the grove.;

tea_build_plantation_4_start_1;Your family's tea farm has become quite famous, boasting not only generations of caretakers, but generations of patrons. However, that popularity ends at your borders -- truthfully, as well tended as the farms are, their tea production simply isn't high enough to meet the demand outside your own lands. Puzzling over this problem, you lock yourself in your study.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1_option;Hmm..;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_2;Laboring into the night, you draw up plans for a grand plantation -- not just one, but tens or perhaps even hundreds of well-tended farms. You will drive production so high that every tea shop across the Four Nations will stock your familial blends. Such an endeavor will be massive, and thus your plan will have to be meticulous.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_1;No cost is too great.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_self;This will be our glory! This will be the plantation of the people!;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_spirits;I have sought the Spirits before, I shall do so again!;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_2;If I'm careful, I can do this on a budget.;
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_bail;I need more time to gather resources.;
tea_build_plantation_4_finish;After almost a decade of labor, your grand vision has been realized: from a humble garden, to a blossoming grove, to a well-kept farm, and now finally to this, a colossal plantation, the absolute apex of a generational love of tea and the desire to spread that passion. Perusing the newly-leafed fields, you think back to all the work your forefathers put in before you, and how all of this must have started with a single inspirational thought after a warm cup of tea. You also think forward, to your children, and their children, and all your descendents, who will always have this plantation as part of their lives, and will feel you and your ancestors love through it. What you've built here isn't just a handful of farms, it's a monument to your whole family, past and future, and by the Spirits, it is glorious!;
tea_build_plantation_4_finish_option;It is magnificent!;
tea_build_plantation_4_fail;It would seem that starting a tea plantation is much more difficult then it seems. Although there's no recouping the money you've sunk into this, you feel like any more investments would just be a waste of time.;
tea_build_plantation_4_fail_option;The farm is enough, I suppose.;

early_guest_start_desc;Milling about your home, you're surprised to hear a knock on the door. It turns out to be one of your acquantinces, dressed in formal attire, looking puzzled at the empty room. "They said that you were hosting a tea party. Well, I brought biscuits!". It seems as though this poor man is confused, and arrived far too early!;
early_guest_start_bad;I'm sorry, there's no party here today.;

early_guest_recovery_desc;"Oh, of course!", the man barges in, excited to see his trip wasn't in vein. The two of you sit for a few hours, gossiping about all sorts of happenings, and in that time you explain you're planning to host a party, so he wasn't entirely wrong. "That sounds marvelous! In that case, here, take some biscuits. They'll be an excellent snack.";

find_physician_desc;You remember, when you were much younger, that your family physician was very fond of tea, and was never without a fresh cup. Thinking back, you distinctly remember the aroma of what she drank, but can't put your finger on exactly what it was. Now that you're planning your own party, you think it might be good to visit her and ask.;

find_physician_market_option;Maybe this?;

find_physician_meeting_desc;Knocking on her door, you see the wrinkly face of your old physician. Now retired, she spends her days tending plants and enjoying tea by herself. Happy to see you, she invites you in, and admits you're the first company she's had in a long time. Sitting at the table, she hands you a cup, and says "Here, a special herbal tea made from homegrown ginger root".;
find_physician_meeting_bad;Ah, it was herbal tea!;
find_physician_meeting_medium;Ma'am, would I be able to borrow some of your special ginger root?;
find_physician_meeting_good;I'm planning a grand tea party, and would love some of your ginger root!;

find_physician_meeting_bad_desc;"Yes, I always loved herbal tea. The root for it is cultivated right here". She gestures to a windowsill garden, with fat ginger-leaves spilling over the side. Although plentiful, you struggle to find the words to ask this old lady if you can have some. In the end, you part ways, going home empty-handed.;

find_physician_meeting_medium_desc;"Oh, certainly", she says, reaching into a planter and pulling out a fresh sample. "Here it is. Be gentle when you brew it. If the water is too hot, or you oversaturate the kettle, you'll end up with a bitter mess!". You laugh, and promise to be careful when you blend the tea yourself. The two of you catch up, and after a short amount of time, you decide to head home, quarry in-hand.;

find_physician_meeting_good_desc;"For you dear, of course. Here, take a jar of it. It's good for the heart. You won't find tea like this anywhere else!". Hastily, she shoves a rather large jar of dried roots into your hands. After spending another hour catching up, the two of you part ways, and you go home prize in-hand.;
