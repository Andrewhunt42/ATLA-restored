#Events
SLAVE_REINSTATE_TITLE;Slavery Reinstated;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
event_slavery_instated_pirate;You give a sickly smile, watching dark clouds bellow from the forge into the sky. Every smith in the city is hard at work, but there's no armor to be made, nor weapons. Instead, you watch as the hammer comes down on a fresh pair of manacles, still red from the furnace. Just a few now, but soon, as many pairs as you need. Overcome with a horrendous glee, you feel as though you're bearing witness to the start of something much larger than yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

event_slavery_instated_not_pirate;Dark rumors have found their way to your court, as word has reached you that slavery is making a resurgence in the Eastern Sea. Once exterminated - first by Avatar Kyoshi's resounding victory over the Fifth Nation, second by a cooperative effort among the Four Nations to liberate the remaining slave holdouts - no sign of the practice has been witnessed in decades. If left unchecked, this market could swell in power, and lead to a complete rebirth of the outlaw-nation.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

BLACK_MARKET_ESTABLISHED_TITLE;Black Market Established;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
BLACK_MARKET_OPTION;Mum's the word.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
event_black_market_established;You'd never think anything was out of the ordinary, wandering the market. Bustling crowds, merchants screaming over one another pushing their wares, the humdrum sounds of life in all directions. But you know the signs. A trader blinking a strange pattern. A quick hand gesture there, followed by a tap on the nose. Suddenly, a homeless man approaches you and horsely belts out "got any coin of the Four nations?". You quietly say back "No, but I have of the Fifth". Cracking a gummy smile, the destitute man whispers "Please, my Lord, follow me".;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
