EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_1_fire;The Fire Sages told me about the Avatar's trainings.\nI have to leave my own home, my Nation, my parents and friends, to see the World, to master all four elements, to become the True Avatar, to keep the balance in the Universe;

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_2_fire;I was already starting to pack my things, but soon the fire sages came and told me that I wouldn't need worldly things anymore. Before they left, they left a gift, a basket of fruit and a stack of knife-shaped coins. That should be enough for the journey and supplies.;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_2_thanks;I appreciate it;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_2_asceticism;I am very grateful, but as you said, I will no longer need worldly things.;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_2_greed;I beg your pardon, shouldn't the Avatar be treated with more reverence?;

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_3_fire;A couple of days later, the fire sages came again. There wasn't much time left, and soon it would be time me to leave. They said there was a whole line of barges and junks lined up at the port. Simple fishermen, merchants, aristocrats, and even Firelord himself, wish to provide ships for the Avatar's voyage to other lands.;

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_400_travel_air_nomads;The Travel to Air Nomads;
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_400_travel_air_nomads;On the path of the Avatar, the journey to one of the Main Four Air Temples was always one of the most difficult challenges. The Air Nomads live in isolation, their major centers located on four edges of the world: In the mountains, high above the sky, and under the cliffs, where they cannot be seen from the ground.\nSometimes they can be seen in the foothill towns or on islands like Kyoshi or Itakshir, where they ask for alms, or trade, buy food, and fly away. They would welcome a fellow traveler, It would not be out of place to say that once Avatar is nominated, they are among the first to send ambassadors, they treat teaching Avatar as one of their main goals in life.\n"By ship or by foot, always move against the Wind, to the places where it is born." - was the last thing I was told.;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_400_southern_temple;I'll go to the Southern Temple, the greatest temple;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_400_eastern_temple;to the Eastern Temple, to the places of the first airbenders;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_400_northern_temple;to the Northern Temple, where Guru Laghima was living;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_400_western_temple;to the Western Temple, where Great Yangchen was born;

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_401_arrival_on_whaletail;Arrival on Whaletail;
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_401_arrival_on_whaletail;The first point on the way to the Southern Air Temple was a small settlement on the coast of the Whaletail island. Although the air nomads do not like to settle on the coast, preferring the mountains and vcliffs, the island was sacred to them. The island has a tradition of fasting, they believe that this place is saturated with a special spiritual universal energy.\nEvery summer hundreds and thousands of air nomads go on pilgrimage to this island, to the place where Monk Tang Xu fasted for 98 days.\nHere, I think I will find fellow travelers for the flight to the Southern Air Temple.;
EVTOPT_new_avatar_400_southern_temple;Let's find them!;
